This guide will walk you through the process of filling out the bulk import spreadsheet for use with the [Bulk Import API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations) to efficiently manage Buyer Organizations, Cost Centers, and Members through bulk import functionality.

## Before you begin

To use the bulk import buyer organization, you must first install and configure the [B2B Suite](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.b2b-suite) and [B2B Organizations](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.b2b-organizations) in your store.

## Step-by-step

1. Download the [template file](https://io.vtex.com.br/b2b-bulk-import/b2b-bulk-import-template.xlsx).
2. Fill in the file with buyer organizations data following the specifications detailed in [File structure for import](#file-structure-for-import).

  >â„¹ Ensure your file is in `.xlsx` format and does not exceed 50MB.

3. Once your file is ready, upload it by making a request to the [Upload file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations#post-/api/b2b/import/buyer-orgs) endpoint.
4. Validate file content by making a request to the [Validate file](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations#post-/api/b2b/import/buyer-orgs/validate/-importId-) endpoint.
5. Once the file is successfully validated, start the bulk data import by making a request to the [Start import](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations#post-/api/b2b/import/buyer-orgs/-importId-) endpoint.

## File structure for import
